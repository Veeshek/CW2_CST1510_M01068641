"""
app.models package

Week 11 (OOP Refactoring):
- This package contains "Entity" classes (domain objects).
- Each class represents a real object from the platform (User, Incident, Dataset, Ticket).
- The goal is to encapsulate:
  1) Data (attributes)
  2) Behaviour (methods / business rules)

This makes the project cleaner, easier to maintain, and more "Object-Oriented".
